# neighbourhood-jab
Script to find out if a jab is available in your neighbourhood

The script is built using Python. 

The script will check for slots in the immediate neighbourhood. Where this differs from the normal script is that this can search for multiple pincodes in your immediate neighbourhood as opposed to a single pincode at a time.
Your immdediate vicinity may have centers under different pincodes. Instead of searching by 1 pincode at a time, this script will bring back results for all the pincodes provided.

Email alert mechanism has been integrated using yagmail. So anyone using it will need to configure yagmail -(https://pypi.org/project/yagmail/)

This script does NOT / CANNOT book slots automatically. Use judiciously.
